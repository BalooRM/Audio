# Audio
Audio conversion script uses pydub and ffmpeg and accepts a WAV filename as input and outputs MP3 files for the combined (stereo) channels and all channels individually. The conversion includes +30dB increase to account for the low recording level in the WAV file. Silence is detected at the beginning. Conversion begins 1 second before the onset of sound above a threshhold (or at track start).
